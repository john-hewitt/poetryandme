# This script is used to prepare a source version of the CMU dict to be compatible with conversion.py
# Converts the CMU dictionary to consist of one line for each word, with multiple entries separated by a % symbol
# The newly generated file can be used to backup/update the CMU_dict.txt file in the src folder
# (By default, each unique pronunciation of a word will appear on its own line)
# SOURCE FILE FROM: http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/cmudict-0.7b
# Note that the source file has been abridged (omits comments and some pronunciations regarding punctuation).
